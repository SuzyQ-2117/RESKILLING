## Introduction
Project 4 is concerned with building the infrastructure on which your application will run. In this case, the GKE.

## Minimum Reference Design

The reference design will be provided by your tutor during the session

**Note** Remember that if you move the DB, you would need to change connection string in application.properties and rebuild.  Similarly, If you deploy the frontend and backend on different machines/locations, you want need to update any hardcoded "localhost" calls in the React Application (and rebuild).
